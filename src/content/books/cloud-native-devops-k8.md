Key Features

Build and run efficient cloud-native applications on Kubernetes using industry best practices
Operate Kubernetes in a production environment, troubleshoot clusters, and address security concerns
Deploy cutting-edge Kubernetes patterns such as service mesh and serverless to your cluster

Book Description

Kubernetes is a modern cloud native container orchestration tool and one of the most popular open source projects worldwide. In addition to the technology being powerful and highly flexible, Kubernetes engineers are in high demand across the industry.

This book is a comprehensive guide to deploying, securing, and operating modern cloud native applications on Kubernetes. From the fundamentals to Kubernetes best practices, the book covers essential aspects of configuring applications. You'll even explore real-world techniques for running clusters in production, tips for setting up observability for cluster resources, and valuable troubleshooting techniques. Finally, you'll learn how to extend and customize Kubernetes, as well as gaining tips for deploying service meshes, serverless tooling, and more on your cluster.

By the end of this Kubernetes book, you'll be equipped with the tools you need to confidently run and extend modern applications on Kubernetes.

What You Will Learn

Set up Kubernetes and configure its authentication
Deploy your applications to Kubernetes
Configure and provide storage to Kubernetes applications
Expose Kubernetes applications outside the cluster
Control where and how applications are run on Kubernetes
Set up observability for Kubernetes
Build a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for Kubernetes
Extend Kubernetes with service meshes, serverless, and more

Who this book is for

This book is for developers, architects, DevOps engineers, or anyone interested in developing and managing cloud-native applications. Those already running cloud applications and looking for a better way to manage their platform or others interested in a career change given the recent popularity of Kubernetes will also find this book helpful. Some familiarity with cloud computing, containers and DevOps is required, but no prior knowledge of building production applications using Kubernetes is needed to get started with this book.
